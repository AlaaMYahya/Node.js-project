# Node.js_project
# Description
Use Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB to build a more advanced API server that can handle user data. The user data is saved in a MongoDB database that is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, and this server is able to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

# Installation
First, recommended to install Node.js and MongoDB.		

To get package.json write in the terminal the following:

  npm init
                
To install express write in the terminal the following:	

  'npm i express'
that will create folder by name 'node_moduls' and also a package-lock.json file.


# Start the server
Write the following in the terminal
 ' npm run dev '

            
# Connecting to MongoDB
Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports Node.js. 

-	Open the server.js file.
-	Search for the mongoose.connect near the bottom which is assigned placeholder text. Replace the placeholder text with the connection string for your Atlas cluster. For more information on finding the connection string, see Connect via Driver in the Atlas documentation.

-	Save the changes to your server.js file.
	

# Defining a Model 
Models are defined through the Schema interface. And can be defined as you need.

# Check
Can check your project by a Postman like me.
